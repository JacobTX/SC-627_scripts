# SC-627_scripts

This contains scripts for different motion planninng and coordination tasks

**Assignment 1** - Motion planning using Bug algorithm

**Assignment 2** - Motion planning using Artificial potential field, Voronoi diagram and Trapezoidal cell decomposition

**Assignment 3** - Achieving synchronization or balanced consensus among multiple agents

The assignments has a **software simulation phase** in which the algorithm was implemented using **ROS** and tested in **Gazebo**, and a **hardware implementation phase** in which the algorithm would be tested in real-world scenarios with actual Turtlebots !

## Connecting laptop to Turtlebot hardware

## Hardware challenges

1) Batteries running out of charge

2) Odom data getting screwed if the bot is moved/lifted manually from one place to another

3) LiDAR has been mounted in the opposite fashion, thus it takes some initial testing to determine which direction corresponds to the front.
